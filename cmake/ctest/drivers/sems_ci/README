This is the simplest CI server you can possibily imagine.  I looked at setting
this up with the TriBITS Dashboard Driver (TDD) system but that is such an
ugly and hacked system that I just could not go through with it.  Therefore, I
have decided that I am going to abandon that old system and create a new
TriBITS Dashboard Driver Plus system that is the most simple and minimal
possible to use CMake/CTest/CDash to drive and monitor the ctest -S script
invocations.

To get this set up on a new machine, just do:

  mkdir <ci_base_dir>
  cd <ci_base_dir>/
  git clone git@github.com:trilinos/Trilinos.git

Then create a cronjob (or Jenkins job) that does:

  cd <ci_base_dir>/ && ./Trilinos/cmake/ctest/drivers/sems_ci/trilinos_ci_sever.sh \
    &> trilinos_ci_sever.out

That is it!

To set this up, I started with a basic ctest -S driver script:

  ctest_linux_mpi_debug_shared_pt_ci.sems.cmake

using TribitsCTestDriverCore.cmake (just like any other automated Trilinos
build).  Then I call that in a simple shell script:

  single_ci_iter.sh

which just sources the standard SEMS env script and calls the ctest -S driver
script.

The last part to this simple CI server is the script:

  trilinos_ci_sever.sh

which uses the simple Python script generic-looping-demon.py to do the CI
loops.

That is it!

There are a few major weaknesses to this approach:

1) If a change is made to the build systems for Trilinos (i.e. in Trilinos or
TriBITS), then the you may get an error since the version of
ctest_linux_mpi_debug_shared_pt_ci.sems.cmake and TribitsCTestDriverCore.cmake
that runs may not be consistent with the updated version of Trilinos and
TriBITS that is pulled by TribitsCTestDriverCore.cmake.  If that happens, one
just needs to kill trilinos_ci_server.sh (using kill-pstree.py) and just run
it again with nohup.

2) If something goes wrong then the CI build just is not uploaded to the
Trilinos CDash site and we can't see if there are any failures.

3) If things go well, the only way to see what the ctest -S script is doing is
to look at the trilinos_ci_server.out log file.

Therefore, this is a temporary solution until we can get something better in
place using a combination of CMake/CTest/CDash and Jenkins.
