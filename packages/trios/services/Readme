This directory contains source code to support Trios Data Services.  

Nessie (NEtwork Scalable Service Interface), also abbrivated as NSSI. 
  Nessie is a parallel client-server framework for data services.  All code in 
  this directory is built using nessie.  
 
pvspy-service:  
  The pvspy-service is an in-transit service that provides staging and computation
  for CTH.  The client implements the pvspy API already used by CTH for in-situ 
  analysis.  The server executes as a parallel ParaView application that uses the 
  co-processing features of ParaView to perform analysis on staged data. 

netcdf-service: 
  The netcdf service provides staging and aggregation for applications using the netcdf
  or PnetCDF api.  The server caches data and either aggregates data or simply
  forwards netcdf calls from the client.  

sql-service: 
  The client provides an SQL-like interface. The server acts as a proxy, forwarding 
  SQL commands to any ODBC-capable server.  This service is valuable on systems that
  do not support traditional database clients.
